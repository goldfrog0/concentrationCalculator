Hello! here are the open "Tickets or feature requests for the project"
These are in order of priority.

* TODO Catching edge cases
- [ ] User wants a concentration higher than they have
- [ ] User wants identical concentration to what they have
* TODO add ml and oz to final output

* DONE def getPositiveValue(message: string) -> float: COMPLETE
** Description:
- type signature would be str -> float
- takes a string as input
  - string is intended to be the prompt for the user
- returns a user input that is a positive float

  - need to reasearch replacement for floats as they are not great

* DONE create def convert_oz_ml() COMPLETE
